# Web-Scraping

Build a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page by clicking the button. 

Complete the initial scraping using **Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter**. And then use **MongoDB with Flask templating** to create a new **HTML** page that displays all of the information that was scraped from the URLs above.
